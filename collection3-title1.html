            <p>This time I made an arrangement of Bella Ciao (Bye, Beautiful Lady), a folk Italian song that became an antifascist anthem which Italians sang to the Nazi troops when they tried to invade Italy during the war as a symbol of freedom and resistance. The Netflix series Money Heist has popularized this song too. I included tremolo technique, as I explain in the video (activate subtitles). </p>
