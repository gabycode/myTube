                Today I want to perform for you a Soleá by the great guitarist Paco Peña called "Santuario". It is a piece I love and in this video I tell you some of its characteristics and curiosities of this flamenco style, la Soleá, and the techniques used in this masterpiece. You can comment, subscribe, like and share with your friends if you liked it! I hope you like it very much!
