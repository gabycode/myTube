                Today the last episode of Game of Thrones was premiered in HBO, so I did this transcription for guitar over the music of the series composed by the great Ramin Djawadi. Hope you like it! I added harmonics to amplify the mistery, chords and melody from the characteristic opening of the series, with modal touches which almost reminds medieval üßô‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èWinter is coming... If you liked it, let me know in comments what's your fav character: mine, Daenerys!
