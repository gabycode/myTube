            <p>We were fortunate enough to get to bring Von Smith on tour with us for our East Coast shows.  Those that saw him already know about his amazing vocal range and powerful stage presence; in this video, we decided to try something different and remake Sia's "Titanium" in the style of a 1940's jazz crooner.</p>
