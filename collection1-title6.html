            <p>Here's our '60s girl group / doo wop style remake of Ellie Goulding's "Burn," complete with a saxophone that shoots fire (called the "Flame-O-Phone," played by Stefan Zeniuk).  Pay special attention to Adam's visibly uncomfortable reaction to seeing 4 foot flames come from the bell of a saxophone, and watch my security deposit go up in flames (both literally and figuratively).  Warning: do not play with fire at home!  Stefan is a trained professional.</p>
